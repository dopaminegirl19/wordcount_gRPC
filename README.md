# A gRPC for word count #

## What does it do? ##
This code takes the path to a folder containing N .txt files containing words, and performs a word count on the pooled words. <br>
The resulting directory looks like this:

```
outputs
└───intermediate
│   │   mr-0-0
│   │   mr-0-1
│   │   mr-0-2
│   │   mr-0-3
│   │   mr-1-0
│   │   mr-1-2
│   │   ...
│   
└───out
│   │   out-0
│   │   out-1
│   │   out-2
│   │   out-3
```
Where the intermediate file names are mr-<map task id>-<reduce task id> and the file output names are out-<reduce task id>. <br>
Each map task id corresponds to an original .txt file, and each reduce task id corresponds to a bucket (M buckets as instructed by the user).<br>
See **Map Task** and **Reduce Task** sections for details.
 
 ## How to run ##
1. First clone the repo:
 ``` git clone https://github.com/dopaminegirl19/wordcount_gRPC.git```
 - You can use the inputs folder provided in the repo, or your own. In the case of the latter, open up  ```mapreduce_client.py``` and update  ```p2inputs``` as the relative path to your desired inputs folder.
 - Similarly, you can specify the desired path to your outputs folder in  ```mapreduce_client.py```.
1. Then ```cd wordcount_gRPC``` or wherever your cloned repo is.
1. Open up a terminal window and start the server:
 ``` python mapreduce_server.py```
1. In another terminal window, start the client:
  ``` python mapreduce_client.py```
1. The server feeds metadata about the process to the client, so in your client terminal you will be informed as the output files are generated and saved. 
 
## Brief overview of code ##
 - This code uses [gRPC](https://grpc.io/) which is google's framework for RPC (remote procedure call). 
 -  ```protos/mapreduce.proto``` specifies the data types and structure in the messages conveyed between the client and the server.
 -  ```mapreduce_pb2.py``` and  ```mapreduce_pb2_grpc.py``` are automatically generated scripts which facilitate the interface between the client, server, and protocol buffer.
 -  ```mapreduce_server.py``` carries out the processes requested by the client.
 -  ```mapreduce_client.py``` receives the user input and formulates the request to send to the server. The user inputs are:
   -  ```p2_inputs``` (string) is the relative path to the .txt files to be parsed 
   - ```p2_intermediate``` (string) is the relative path to the folder in which the server should store the intermediate output files.
   - ```p2_final``` (string) is the relative path to the folder in which the server should store the final output files. 
 - In ```example_outputs``` you can see what the output is if you run the code as is. 
 
 ### Map Task ###
 The map task is called with a MapRequest, consisting of:
 1. ```input_path``` (string), relative path to folder containing .txt files to parse
 1. ```output_path``` (string), relative path to folder containing intermediate output files
 1. ```M``` (int32), number of buckets <br>

 The map task is carried out by the server. The server takes the input files, separates text into single words, and puts each word into a "bucket" (intermediate file). The bucket is decided by (first letter of the word) % M. Thus, a total of M files are produced, and each have one word on each line.<br>
 These intermediate files are saved in the specified output_path.<br>
 
The map task returns a ```stream``` of output file names, which are displayed to the user as they are saved. This is because in theory there could be a great many input .txt files to parse, so this way the user can follow the progress of the server.
